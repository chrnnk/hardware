1.0 Introduction for Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2  

Windows 7 is the client release of the operating system.  Windows Server
2008 R2 is the server version of this release.  In all of the information
below, this release will be referred to as Windows 7, but that will also
include the Server 2008 R2 releases as well.

Windows 7 is an operating system designed to run on Intel architecture (x86,
32-bit), Itanium Processor Family (IA64), and Extended-64 (x64, AMD64/EM64T)
processors using current technology. It provides a graphical user interface
environment incorporating many high-level features. Note that Windows 7 is
supported only on 32-bit and x64 processors, and Server 2008 R2 is supported
only on x64 and IA64 processors. Refer to the Microsoft Windows 7 / Server
2008 R2 documentation for details.

An I/O manager handles I/O requests in Windows 7. To address a peripheral, the
I/O manager goes through the appropriate drivers. Windows 7 provides class
drivers for hard disk, optical, CD-ROM, printer, and scanner peripherals. Other
class drivers, provided by peripheral manufacturers, may be added to support
new devices. Tape device support is built into the operating system itself and
does not require a class driver. 

Microsoft provides the port driver and LSI Corporation provides the miniport
drivers, which is called LSI_SAS2.SYS.  This driver completes the path to the
LSI controller or processor with an optional SAS BIOS.

This miniport driver uses the Microsoft StorPort port driver (rather than
the Microsoft ScsiPort driver in earlier versions of Windows).  The StorPort
driver has architectural enhancements that provide performance improvements on
large server systems with many storage adapters.  This miniport driver is
designed to take advantage of these enhancements for improved performance.

.........................................................................
1.1 Features 

The LSI_SAS2.SYS miniport driver supports these features:

o  Supports End-to-End Data Protection (EEDP)
o  Supports 1.5Gb, 3Gb, and 6Gb SAS expanders/devices and SATA devices
o  Supports PCI-Express bus protocols
o  Supports MSI/MSI-X
o  Supports LSI MPT common software interface 
o  Supports multiple host adapters 
o  Supports multiple Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs) 
o  Supports Scatter-Gather 
o  Supports SCSI pass-through functionality 
o  Supports disk array configurations with no LUN 0 
o  Supports disk array configurations with non-contiguous LUNs 
o  Supports Storport Interrupt Redirection performance enhancements 
o  Auto request sense 
o  Maximum block size support: 1 Mbyte (32-bit), 2 Mbyte (64-bit)
.........................................................................
1.2 LSI Devices Supported 

The miniport driver names are listed below, along with their supported
devices and associated host adapters:

LSI_SAS2.SYS - "LSI Fusion-MPT SAS2 Miniport Driver"
o  LSISAS2004
o  LSISAS2008
o  LSISAS2108
o  LSISAS2116
o  LSISAS2208
o  LSISAS2308

.........................................................................
1.3 Description

The LSI_SAS2.SYS driver meets the Microsoft specification for miniport drivers.
These drivers allow connection of SAS devices including disk drives,
CD/DVD-ROMs, and tape drives for PCI-Express based machines. To support a
different SAS device type, the Windows 7 architecture requires that a class
driver for that type of device be present (usually supplied by Microsoft, or
possibly by the peripheral manufacturer). No changes to the LSI drivers are
required. The driver supports only Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2 and all
subsequent Service Packs. 

A Windows application passes SCSI commands directly to the SAS Protocol devices
by using the SCSI pass-through facility. This facility allows applications to
directly control and access devices by filling in a data structure and calling
into the port or class driver. Refer to the Microsoft Windows 7 documentation
for more details.

............................................................................
2.0 Installing the LSI_SAS2.SYS Driver


This procedure installs the LSI_SAS2.SYS driver onto a new or existing Windows
7 system. Depending upon the media used to distribute LSI drivers (web or
CD-ROM) and the type of adapter, you will create a driver install package on
some type of accessible media.  This can be a diskette, CD or DVD, or USB flash
drive.  The driver install package can also be placed on a hard disk for driver
upgrades only.

Copy the files listed in this section to a folder on the desired media as shown
below. You will use this driver package during the installation process.

        lsi_sas2.inf
        lsi_sas2.sys
        lsinodrv.inf
        wdcfg.exe
        DriverConfigParam.def
        svlhx86.cat (for x86) or
        svlhia64.cat (for IA64) or
        svlhx64.cat (for x64)
        
Note: Windows drivers must be either Release signed (by LSI) or WHQL logo
      signed (by Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs) to be installed on
      Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2.  Any modifications to any of the above files
      will invalidate the digital signature of the package and the OS will
      not install the driver.

............................................................................
2.1 New System Installation 

This procedure installs the LSI_SAS2.SYS driver onto a Windows 7 system. Use
this procedure when installing Windows 7 onto an unused drive. Windows 7
automatically adds the driver to the registry and copies the driver to the
driver storage area.

Note: Windows 7 contains a bundled LSI_SAS2 driver. This drivers will support a
      fresh installation of Windows 7. If a newer driver is to be installed,
      the fresh installation can be done with the bundled driver and the driver
      can be upgraded after installation has completed as described in Section
      2.2.  Or, the newer driver can be used for fresh installation as
      described in the following section.

............................................................................
2.1.1 DVD-ROM Installation

1. Start the Windows 7 installation by booting from the Windows 7 DVD-ROM:

   The system BIOS must support booting from a DVD-ROM. BIOS settings may need

............................................................................
2.3 Performance Tuning for Windows 7

Windows 7 has registry entries that can be used to tune the performance of SCSI
I/O for certain configurations. The registry settings of NumberOfRequests and
MaximumSGList are not used by StorPort and will have no effect on the
LSI_SAS2.SYS driver.

............................................................................
2.3.1 Miniport Driver Configuration Options

The LSI_SAS2.SYS driver is configured by default to provide optimum
performance in most standard systems.

However, it is possible to fine-tune certain driver parameters using a utility
provided on the OS installation disk, the Windows Driver Configuration Utility
(WDCFG).

The WDCFG utility is fully installed automatically as part of the driver
installation.

To use the utility, first launch a Command Prompt window.  In the Command Prompt 
window, enter the "wdcfg -?" command to display full usage information.  The 
usage information explains how to query and set parameters, and how to use the
utility to display a list of driver configuration parameters which can be
controlled using the utility (including full explanations of each).

Note that parameter changes are only activated within the driver following a
driver initialization.  This may be done by restarting the machine, or by using
Device Manager to disable and re-enable the driver (Take care not to do this
to a driver servicing the boot volume).

............................................................................
2.4 WinPE Installation

WinPE is provided to system OEM's to create a Pre-install Environment image.
To use the LSI_SAS2.SYS driver with the Windows 7 based WinPE, perform the
steps listed below.

1. Create an lsi_sas2 folder in the winpe_image directory under i386\system32.
   For example: mkdir winpe_image\i386\system32\lsi_sas2
 
2. Copy the lsi_sas2 driver package to the winpe_image\i386\system32\lsi_sas2
   folder.

3. Edit the winpe_image\i386\System32\Winpeoem.sif to remove the semicolons
   from the [OemDriverParams] section and add the name of the lsi_sas2
   directory to the OemDriverDirs entry. For example:

   [OemDriverParams]
   OemDriverRoot = ""
   OemDriverDirs = lsi_sas2
 
4. You can then use oscdimg to create a bootable .iso image, or follow the
   WinPE User's Guide to create a bootable USB flash device.

............................................................................
3.0 Troubleshooting 

The LSI_SAS2.SYS driver will log error messages to the system error log. For
these errors, the system errorlog EventID will be 11, and the specific error
code values will be displayed at offset 0x10. Data should be displayed in words.
